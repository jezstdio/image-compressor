# Image compressor for my collegues @ Auchan EEGP

- It has a QR code which directs to the website itself, so customer's can use it.
- You can upload your image, compress it and download it.
- Download image by tapping the compressed ones.
- You can upload multiple images at once.

That's it. Nothing fancy. I did it in about 30 minutes because the original company which requires maximum 5MB images couldn't do it. Yes. They just couldn't.
